## Main functions

### Empirical density

- `pemp` empirical CDF
- `demp` empirical PDF
- `qemp` empirical quantile function
- `remp` draw random value from empirical CDF

### Chakraborti N estimation

- `n_locshift` estimate N based on two pilot samples
- `resample_n_locshift` compute a number of resamples and estimate N for each of them. You get a distribution of N estimates based on a single set of pilot samples.
