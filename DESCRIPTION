Description: Estimate necessary sample sizes for comparing the location
    of data from two groups or categories when the distribution of the 
    data is skewed. This is useful, because assuming a normal distribution
    may lead to overestimations of the necessary sample size. The package 
    offers non-parametric methods for a Wilcoxon Mann-Whity test of 
    location shift as well as methods for several generalized linear 
    models, for instance, Gamma regression.
